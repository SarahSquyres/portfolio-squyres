### User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


### Description

I have built this portfolio to showcase my skills and style as a software engineer. 

The navigation bar at allows the user to explore the application by simply clicking where they would like to go. Sections include Home, About Me, Projects, Resume, and Contact.

The Resume link will take the user directly to my Google Docs Resume.  Also, the Contact section is functional and allows app visitors to send me emails.
